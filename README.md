# FuelPHP Evernote package

This package provides a wrapper for the Evernote PHP SDK.

The intention is to make for an easier interaction with the [Evernote API](http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/). The code is inspired by [https://github.com/rizumita/fuel-evernote](https://github.com/rizumita/fuel-evernote) and the [PHP GitHub API]( https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api )


The API method splits the Evernote API into logical sections and runs the relavent methods from the Evernote SDK.
